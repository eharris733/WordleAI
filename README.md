# WordleAI
A python script meant to solve the popular game wordle, running a simulation for every valid word using a variety of increasingly effective methods. 


If you are curious about the workings of this project, I have written a report on both the rules of Wordle and the various considerations of my code, including but not limited to 
the algorithms, run time and space complexity, as well as a brief overview of other literature on the topic.
